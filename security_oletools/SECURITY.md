## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you would like to report a vulnerability affecting the oletools project,
you may use the link "[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/security/advisories/new)" 
on Github. 

If you prefer not to use Github, please send a first email to decalage at laposte dot net, without giving
technical details. You will then be provided with a GPG public key to send
encrypted emails.

Alternatively you may also contact me via X/Twitter, Mastodon or BlueSky
using private messages (see https://linktr.ee/decalage) to get the GPG key.

Please note that oletools is a non-commercial open-source project maintained 
on my spare time. I will do my best to answer in due time and fix 
vulnerabilities.
